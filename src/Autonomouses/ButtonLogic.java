/**
 * ButtonLogic
 * This class stores the commmand and operational logic that is "connected" to a joystick button,
 * as assigned within the OI.java class.  The idea is that a recorded button press can be processed
 * with this class to execute (or not) the appropriate command function from a replay file.
 * The goal is to provide button-press replay functionality from a file that has recorded
 * actual robot motion and button pressing when executing a path and command history that is to
 * be replayed during an autonomous period.  Goals are good.
